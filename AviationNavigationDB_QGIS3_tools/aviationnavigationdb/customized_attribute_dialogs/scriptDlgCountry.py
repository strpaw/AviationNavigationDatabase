"""
QGIS forms can have a Python function that is called when the form is
opened.

Use this function to add extra logic to your forms.

Enter the name of the function in the "Python Init function"
field.
An example follows:
"""
from qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets import QWidget

def my_form_open(dialog, layer, feature):
	geom = feature.geometry()
	control = dialog.findChild(QWidget, "MyLineEdit")
